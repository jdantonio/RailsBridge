# RailsBridge Sample Code

I have volunteered to teach at [Cleveland RailsBridge](http://clevelandrailsbridge.org/)
on September 5th and 6th, 2014. In preparation I am working through the entire RailsBridge
[curriculum](http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/) (or as much as I can get done). For fun
I am attempting to do all the work in as much of a [functional style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
as possible. Specifically, this means:

* Making all functions [referentially transparent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science))
  and, when possible, [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent)
* Using immutable data structures from my [functional-ruby](http://functional-ruby.com) gem
* Using immutable collections from the [Hamster](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster) gem
* Programming client-side code in [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)

## Versions

* 1.0.0 -- Completed the [RailsBridge Intro To Rails](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/) tutorials verbatim.
